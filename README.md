# Automations
I attempted to set up an automation in Google Sheets to send deadline reminders using Google Apps Script, but I ran into some errors that prevented it from running.

What Happened

The script was designed to check deadlines and send email reminders automatically.
When I tried running it, errors popped up, and it did not execute as expected.
I suspect the issue is related to my school account’s restrictions on running external scripts or sending automated emails.
Possible Issues

Account Restrictions – My school account may have security settings that prevent scripts from sending emails or accessing certain features.
Authorization Errors – The script might require additional permissions that I wasn’t able to grant.
Script or Sheet Setup Issues – There could be an issue with how the sheet is named or how the columns are referenced in the script.
